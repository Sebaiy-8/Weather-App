# Weather App

A simple and intuitive Weather Application that allows users to search for weather information based on a city name. The app displays detailed weather information for the current day, the next two days, and includes details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can enter the name of a city to get the current weather information.
- **3-Day Weather Forecast**: Shows weather details for today, tomorrow, and the day after.
- **Detailed Weather Information**: Includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.
- **Powered by API**: Fetches real-time weather data using an external weather API.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for the application structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the layout and design.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for a responsive and modern UI.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and dynamically displaying weather details.
- **Weather API**: Integrates with a public weather API to get real-time data.

## How It Works

1. **Search Input**: Users enter the name of the city they want to get weather data for.
2. **API Call**: The app makes an API request to a weather service, retrieving data for the city.
3. **Weather Display**: The app displays the weather data for today, tomorrow, and two days after that in a clean and organized format.
4. **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, ensuring a good experience across devices.
